# Crowd Brushes

Tools for controlling how crowd elements are placed and configured in your scene. Brushes define instance properties, animation settings, and placement rules for creating diverse and natural-looking crowds.

## 1. Paint Settings
> - **Mesh Index selection:** If using Bone Animation types you can select which sub mesh to use here
> - **Shadow casting options:** Toggle shadow casting on the instances when they are placed in the level

## 2. Per Instance Animation Data
> - **Animation List Logic:** Select and edit your Animation Logic settings. For more information see [Animation Logic](animation-logic.md)

## 3. Painting Settings
> - **Density (per 1Kuu):** Controls the number of instances placed within a 10mÂ² area
> - **Min Distance Between Instances:** Sets the minimum spacing required between newly placed instances within the paint brush area
> - **Scaling Mode:** Select from various scaling constraints Uniform, Free and Lock XY/XZ/YZ
> - **Scale (X, Y, Z):** Define minimum and maximum scale values for each axis - instances will be randomly scaled within these bounds

## 4. Placement Settings
> - **Z Offset:** Adjusts the vertical position of instances in the level. Use different Min/Max values to create random height variations
> - **Align to Normal:** Automatically orients instances to match the surface normal direction they are painted on (limited by **Ground Slope Angle**)
> - **Average Normal:** Smooths instance orientation by averaging nearby surface normals on uneven terrain
> - **Average Normal Single Component:** Limits normal averaging to a single component for more controlled orientation
> - **Ground Slope Angle:** Defines the minimum and maximum slope angles where instances can be painted and aligned with normals
> - **Brush Yaw:** Controls instance facing direction. Set different Min/Max values to create random rotations around the vertical axis
> - **Brush Pitch:** Controls forward/backward tilt angle. Set Min/Max bounds to randomize the pitch of placed instances

## Creating Brushes

There are three ways to create a brush asset.

**Direct Addition:**
> - Click "+ Mesh/Brush Asset" in Crowd Editor
> - Select your [VA Asset Collection](va-asset-collection.md)
> - Choose where to save the new brush asset

**Drag and Drop:**
> - Drag [VA Asset Collection](va-asset-collection.md) to "Drop Your Assets Here" area
> - Choose where to save the new brush asset

> ![Add Brush](assets/crowd_add_brush.jpg){width="70%" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;"}

**Right Click Menu:**
> - Right click your [VA Asset Collection](va-asset-collection.md) in the content browser and choose `Make Vertex Crowd Brush`
> - Choose where to save the new brush asset
