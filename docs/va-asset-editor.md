## Interface Overview

The VA Asset Editor window contains several key elements that help you manage and customize your vertex animations:

### 1. Rebuild Asset Button
Located in the top toolbar, this button reconstructs your mesh and materials. Use this after making any adjustments in the details panel to ensure your changes are properly applied.

### 2. Preview Mesh Selection
For Bone VA Asset Collections that contain multiple meshes, this dropdown menu allows you to switch between different meshes in the preview window. This is particularly useful when working with collections that include variations of the same character or object.

### 3. Reapply Custom Data
This feature enables you to inject custom float data into your instanced VA mesh. By modifying these values, you can create visual variations between instances, ensuring each character or object appears unique in your scene.

### 4. Details Panel
The right-side panel contains crucial settings divided into several categories:

- Mesh Build Settings
- Animation Data Settings
- Mesh Runtime Data Settings
- Asset Validation
- Animation Build Settings

These settings allow you to fine-tune various aspects of your vertex animation. (Detailed information about each category will be covered in later sections)

### 5. Animation Preview
The timeline area displays your currently selected preview animation. You can switch between different animations to visualize how your asset will appear in-game.

### 6. Animation Timeline
The bottom panel provides standard timeline controls for previewing your animations. Use these controls to play, pause, and scrub through your animation sequences.
