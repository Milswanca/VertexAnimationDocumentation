# Single Placement Tool

The Single Placement tool allows for precise, individual placement of crowd elements in your scene with individual control over position and orientation.

## Usage
> The Single Placement tool primarily uses keyboard shortcuts for adjusting instances, with a handy shortcut overlay visible in the bottom right of the screen. For a complete list of shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](crowd-tools-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

### Basic Controls
> - **Mouse Placement**: Click to place an instance at the cursor location
> - **Rotation**: 
>     - Use `Z` and `X` keys to rotate left and right respectively
>     - Hold left mouse button and drag to rotate the instance. Release to place with the current rotation
> - **Size Adjustment**: Use `Ctrl + Scroll Wheel` to resize the instance

### Placement Settings
> Instance placement is affected by the selected crowd brush's placement settings, including:
>
> - Surface alignment
> - Height offset
> - Rotation constraints
> - Other placement rules

For detailed brush configuration options, see [Crowd Brushes](crowd-brushes.md).
